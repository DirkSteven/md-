## <a id = "proj-ob"> üéØProject Overview </a>
1. ID-image Generator: One of the features of this product is the ability to create identification card images. These images include a photo of the person, as well as their personal information such as name, date of birth, and ID number.

2. Secured ID-image: the generated output goes a step further in terms of security by incorporating image steganography; an image that contains hidden information or data that can only be accessed by authorized individuals. 

3. Embed specific "message" in an image: Another feature of this product allows for the embedding of a specific message or authentication code within the image. However, this feature is only accessible to university administrators. It can be utilized to indicate an individual's position within the university.

4. ID-Scanner: The last feature allows it to read and scan and images to seek for concealed information. This will make it easier to verify that the file is authentic and not a falsification.
